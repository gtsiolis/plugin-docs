# Base font size setting
The **Base Font Size** provides the value for `1rem` in the plugin.

This feature not only supports responsive design decisions but also ensures the adaptability of the design, similar to how engineers work in code. 

When you assign a Token's value in rem units, the property is related to the Base Font Size, which the user of your product or website can adjust. 
- For example, if the user increases the font size or uses a zoom feature, all design properties defined in `rem units` will respond accordingly. 

In contrast, design elements defined in `pixels` will remain the same regardless of the user settings. 

Figma does not support `rem units` in Design Mode, but it will show a loose conversion of rem units in Dev Mode, always assuming 1rem = 16px.

## In the plugin 
When working with the Tokens Studio plugin for Figma, it automatically converts `rem units` to `pixels` for you. 

The value of the **Base Font Size** is `16px` by default, but it can be changed. 
- The plugin supports the value of the **Base Font Size** token to reference another token if desired. 
- This could be helpful for sophisticated token structures, where a different Base Font Size is defined for each brand or theme.

### View the current base font size setting
Navigate to the **Settings Page** in the plugin.
- Scroll down to the **Base Font Size** section.

- The current value of `1rem` unit 

## Change the base font size setting
Navigate to the **Settings Page** in the plugin.
- Scroll down to the **Base Font Size** section.
- Select the **Change Button** to the left of the current value being displayed.
- The **Change Base Font Size Modal** will open
- Enter a new value in the form field:
	- **Hard-coded value** in `pixels`
		- For example: `18px`
	- **Reference a token** by typing it's name in curly brackets or selecting the dropdown button
		- For example: `{rem-base}`
		- The compatible token types you will see are `number`, `dimension` and `fontSize`
- Select the **Confirm Button** to save your changes.
- The new value for `1rem` will appear in the **Base Font Size** settings.

## Limitations and known issues
When working with the plugin's Base Font Size setting, there are a couple of things to be aware of.

### The setting follows you across Figma files
The **Base Font Size** setting in the plugin is related to your Tokens Studio user account. 
- This means the setting is **not** specific to your Figma file or sync provider. 
- Changes made to this setting will apply to every Figma file. 

If you work on many projects with different values for this setting, it is a good practice to check the **Base Font Size** value each time you open a new Figma file. 

If the plugin can not find the token referenced in the setting, you will see a **Broken Token icon** next to the value as a reminder to change it.

### Values to watch for
There is a known issue with the form field, where it accepts some values that it should not. Until the issue is fixed, you'll want to avoid:
- Values with rem units 
	- The plugin will drop the unit and assume the number is the value in pixels.
	- For example, `1rem` will be `1px` as the value
- Empty value
	- The plugin will assume `16px` when the input is empty.
- Typos in the value
	- Incomplete references can be saved but will appear as broken on the settings page.
	- For example, `{base-token` is missing the closing curly bracket `}`
