# Plugin settings 
The **Settings page** is where you can make personalized configurations to the plugin. 

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ú¶">
The plugin remembers your settings across all Figma files. \
For settings that change by project, like your active **Sync Provider**, you'll want to check the **Settings Page** each time you open the plugin in a new Figma file. 
</Callout>

## 1. License key 
When you upgrade to a pro licence for Tokens Studio, you add the key here. 
- Be sure to press the **Add licence key** button when you are finished. 

It's a good idea to keep a copy of your licence key handy wherever you safely store your passwords. 

You can always grab it again by [logging into your Tokens Studio account](https://account.tokens.studio/email-login)

If you haven't upgraded to pro yet, select the **GET PRO** button by the licence key input to open a browser page with more details. 

## 2. Sync providers
By default, Tokens Studio will store your design tokens locally in the Figma file you are working in, but their true power is unleashed when they can be synced with code. 

You can manage your sync providers from the **Settings Page**.

### Token format
To support moving towards the W3C Specifications for Design Tokens, as managed by the Design Tokens Community Group (DTCG), you can choose a Design Token Format that defines how tokens are written in their JSON files.

## 3. Language settings
The plugin supports multiple languages thanks to the generous contributions of our open-source community members! 

Use the **Language Selector** to choose from:
- English
- French
- Dutch
- Chinese
- Hindi 
- Spanish

Want to contribute to add a new language? Reach out to us on our community slack!

## 4. Base font size setting
The plugin sets the Base Font Size to 16px by default. To change this value, use the Change button and follow the prompts.

## 5. Permission for session recording
Enabling this setting creates a unique ID that can be shared with the Tokens Studio support team to help troubleshoot issues you might be having. 

The recorded telemetry data collected is anonymized and is not shared with any third parties. 

You can leave this setting disabled until a support team asks you to turn it on. 

## 6. Reset onboarding
If it's been a while since you used the plugin, this setting will open the onboarding content we show new users to the plugin. 

## These settings have moved
The plugin's V2 release made some major changes to the way we work with Styles and Variables in Figma. 

As a result, we moved the related settings to the new **Export to Figma** workflow, in the **Options menu**. 
- Ignore first part of token name for styles.
- Prefix styles with active theme name.
