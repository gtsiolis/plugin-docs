# Delete a sync provider 
Once a project is completed, you may wish to remove a sync provider from the plugin. 
- You can always add it again later

## Steps in the plugin for Figma
Open the Tokens Studio plugin and navigate to the **settings** page. 
1. Navigate to the **sync provider** of your choice in the list.
2. Select the **three-dot menu icon** on the right side of the **sync provider** details.
3. Select **delete** from the menu options.

### Delete sync provider modal
A **modal** will open to **confirm** that you want to delete this sync provider. 
- If you select **yes** 
	- The sync provider will be removed from the settings page of the plugin
	- The Tokens currently in the plugin will be stored locally by default. 
	- The modal will close and the local document option will be selected in the list of sync providers on the plugin's settings page. 
- If you select **cancel**
	- The modal will close and you'll be returned to the plugin's Settings page. 
	- The sync provider will remain on the plugin's settings page. 
- If you close the modal without making a selection
	- The sync provider will remain on the plugin's settings page.

If you don't want to work with your Tokens stored locally, you can add a new sync provider or choose an existing one from the settings page.
