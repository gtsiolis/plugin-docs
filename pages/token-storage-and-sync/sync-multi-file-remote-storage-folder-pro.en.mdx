# Multi-file sync (pro) to remote Token Storage

import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout'

 *Pro Feature*\
    The **Multi-file sync to remote storage** feature requires a [Pro Licence](https://tokens.studio/pricing) for Tokens Studio. 
</Callout>

The Multi-file sync feature allows you to sync your Token data to your remote Token storage provider in multiple JSON files, which live within a folder. []()

When you use the **Themes (pro)** feature in Tokens Studio and your engineers consume your Tokens from GitHub, the transformation process requires Tokens stored in multiple files.

## Sync provider settings
To set up **Multi-file sync**, follow the steps in the guide for your Sync provider's **Folder** option of **Token Storage Location**. 
- [Azure DevOps](/token-storage-and-sync/sync-provider-azure-devops)
- [Bitbucket](/token-storage-and-sync/sync-provider-bitbucket)
- [GitHub](/token-storage-and-sync/sync-provider-github)
- [Gitlab](/token-storage-and-sync/sync-provider-gitlab)

When our Tokens are stored in a folder
- Each **Token Set** created in the plugin is added to the folder as an individual JSON file. 
- Additional data files generated by the plugin are also added to the folder. 
	- For example, `Themes` configuration.

The following image shows the Github sync provider form with examples of the **Token storage location** as Folder and File paths. Your sync provider form may look different but the concept is the same.

## Sharing multi-file sync with teammates
The **Multi-file sync** feature requires a pro Tokens Studio licence, so what happens if other members of your team have a free licence? 

When they **Pull** in your Tokens saved in your remote storage in **Multi-file sync**, they will be limited to **read-only access** in the plugin. 

Teammates with pro licences for Tokens Studio will have the same collaborative access you establish with your sync provider. 

### Read only for free licence holders
In **read-only** access to your Tokens, your teammates can:
- View Tokens and themes.
- Theme switch. 
- Apply Tokens. 
- Pull updates from your sync provider.

They can not:
- Edit Tokens or themes.
- Push to your sync provider.
- Export styles or variables to Figma or update their values.

This can be a great way to limit access to editing your Tokens and keep your team costs down.
