# Branch switching (pro)

import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout'

<Callout emoji="‚ú¶">
 *Pro Feature*\
    The **Branch switching** feature requires a [Pro Licence](https://tokens.studio/pricing) for Tokens Studio. 
</Callout>

If you are working with one of these sync providers, you can use the plugin native integration to take advantage of **branch** workflows:
- [Azure DevOps](/token-storage-and-sync/sync-provider-azure-devops)
- [Bitbucket](/token-storage-and-sync/sync-provider-bitbucket)
- [GitHub](/token-storage-and-sync/sync-provider-github)
- [Gitlab](/token-storage-and-sync/sync-provider-gitlab)

By default, Tokens Studio will connect to the **branch** you added in your **sync provider form**, for example, `main`. 

However, you can **create a new branch** or **switch branches** using the plugin. 

## Branch indicator
When you are connected to **Sync Provider** that supports branching, the bottom of the plugin has **Sync Actions**. 

The **Branch Button** is on the left, displaying the current branch you are working on. 

In this example, the `main` branch is active.

### View available branches
**Selecting the branch name** from the **Sync Actions** at the bottom of the plugin will open the **Branch menu** which displays:
1. An option to **Create a new branch**.
2. Available branches from your sync provider. 

The branches visible in the plugin come from your sync provider. 
- The plugin can't remove any branches from the list; you have to log into your sync provider to delete branches.

### Switch branches
**Select the branch name** from the **Sync Actions** at the bottom of the plugin to see the available branches you can switch between. 
- **Select a new branch name** to switch to that branch. 
- The plugin will open the **Pull modal** to see if you want to replace your existing tokens with the Tokens in the new branch you've selected.

### Create a new branch
**Select the branch name** from the **Sync Actions** at the bottom of the plugin to open the **Branch menu**. 
- Select the **Create a new branch from** option.
- You'll see a list of current branches from your Sync provider.
- **Select the branch** you want to make your new branch from.
	- Choosing an existing branch (like `main`) will:
		- Ignore any local changes you have made to your Tokens in the plugin.  
		- Pull in the Tokens from the branch you selected as the starting place for your new branch. 
	- Choosing **Current changes** will:
		- Take the Tokens exactly as you have them in the plugin as the starting place for your new branch. 
- Follow the prompts in the plugin to finish creating your new branch.
	- If you have unsaved changes in the plugin (blue push notification is visible), you will be prompted to **push** your changes to the **Sync Provider** before creating the new branch so they aren't lost. 
- Once the new branch is created, the plugin will open the **Push Modal** to sync your Tokens to your new branch.

## Limitations of branch switching
Sometimes, when you open the plugin, it reverts to the default branch in your **Sync Provider** configuration, for example, `main`. 

Other times, new branches created in a local file are automatically applied in all files sharing the same sync provider, which is not always desired. 

So, it's important to double-check which branch you are working on each time you open the plugin. 
- The **name of the branch you are working on** appears at the bottom of the plugin for easy reference. 

You can switch branches by following the steps above at any time.
