# Edit a sync provider 
Once a Sync provider is added to Tokens Studio, you may need to change the credentials.

## Steps in the plugin for Figma
Open the Tokens Studio plugin and navigate to the **settings** page. 
1. Navigate to the **sync provider** of your choice in the list.
2. Select the **three-dot menu icon** on the right side of the **sync provider** details.
3. Select **edit** from the menu options.

### Sync provider modal
A **modal** will open with a form to **edit the necessary credentials**. 

Each provider's form will look slightly different. If you need help on how to fill out the form, make sure to check out their specific documentation for detailed instructions:

Select **Save** to continue.

### Remote storage providers
Once you **Save** your credentials, the plugin will compare your Tokens with whats in your repository. 

You may see a modal asking you to **push** or **pull** to 'sync' the plugin data with your storage provider, depending on the type of provider, permissions, and the Tokens you have in the plugin. 

These images show the **push** and **pull** modals for a new GitHub sync, but it will look similar for most providers.

#### Pull from provider 
If your sync provider already has Design Tokens, you'll see a dialogue asking if you want to **pull** your Tokens in. 
- If you select **yes** 
	- Tokens in your remote storage will be **pulled** into the plugin. 
	- Any Tokens currently in the plugin will be replaced with the Tokens in your remote storage, and they can not be recovered.
	- Once the pull is complete, the modal will close and you'll be returned to the **Settings** page of the plugin. 
- If you select **cancel**
	- Tokens currently in the plugin will remain, and you can choose to push them to your sync provider later. 
	-  The modal will close and you'll be returned to the **Settings** page of the plugin. 
- If you close the modal without making a selection
	- Tokens currently in the plugin will remain, and you can choose to push them to your sync provider later. 
	- Closing the modal returns you to the **Settings** page of the plugin.

#### Push from local 
If your sync provider does not have code files with Design Tokens, you'll see a modal asking if you want to **push**. 

This would **push** or "send" the current Tokens in the plugin to your sync provider.
- If you select **Push changes** 
	- The **commit message** is required. 
		- You can think of it as a short note to your engineers about what you are **pushing**, such as "initial token load." 
	- Tokens in the plugin will be **pushed** to your remote storage. 
	- Once the pull is complete, the modal will close and you'll be returned to the **Settings** page of the plugin. 
- If you select **cancel**
	- Tokens currently in the plugin will remain, and you can choose to push them to your sync provider later. 
	-  The modal will close and you'll be returned to the **Settings** page of the plugin. 
- If you close the modal without making a selection
	- Tokens currently in the plugin will remain, and you can choose to push them to your sync provider later. 
	- Closing the modal returns you to the **Settings** page of the plugin. 

## Sync provider has been updated
The sync provider will be connected and appear in the **settings page** as **Active**.

If you don't want this sync provider to be active in your current file, you can choose a different one from the list.
