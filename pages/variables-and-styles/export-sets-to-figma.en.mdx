# Export to Figma from Token Sets
Free licence holders for Tokens Studio can attach their Tokens to Styles and Variables in Figma by Exporting to Figma from Token Sets. 

This has some limited capabilities compared to when you Export to Figma from Themes (Pro). 
- Create and maintain Styles and Variables in Figma powered by Token Sets in the plugin.
	- A Variable collection is created for each Token Set exported. 
	- Creating modes within a Variable Collection is not possible when exporting from Token Sets. 
- Choose which Token Sets are attached to Styles and Variables. 
	- Styles can have Variable references.
- Local Styles and Variables supported (within the same Figma File). 
	- `Non-local Variable references` are not possible when exporting from Token Sets.

‚Üí [Read the Export to Figma from Themes guide for more details on these features.](/variables-and-styles/export-themes-to-figma-pro)

## How it works
Once you have created Tokens in the plugin, select the **Styles & Variables Button** from the Tokens page. 

Choose the **Export styles & variables** option.

![](/variables-and-styles/Tokens-export-flow-ref-2-01.png)

The **Export Options** menu will open and allow you to choose which actions the plugin should perform on the Tokens included in your export:
- Export your tokens as Variables, Styles or both.
- Choose any Style export specific settings.
- Choose any update specific settings.

‚Üí [Read the Export to Figma Options guide for more details.](/variables-and-styles/export-to-figma-options-menu)

Once you confirm your Options, you'll see the Export as Token Sets or Themes page. This is where you choose which Tokens are included in your export. 
- If you have a Free licence for Tokens Studio, you'll be brought directly to the **Token Sets** tab. 

![](/variables-and-styles/exportoptions-setsFlow-ref-2-01.png)

### Export from Token Sets
The **Export from Token Sets** page will display the **Number of Token Sets** selected for export.

By default, the number of Token Sets selected will match the configuration from the plugin's Tokens Page before you start the Export process. 
- For example, if only my "Primitive" Token Set was `Enabled` with the checkmark visible next to the Token Set Name on the left side of the Tokens Page, my **Export from Token Sets** would say `1 of X Sets selected for export`.  

Token Sets with a status of **Reference/Set as Source** are not included in the count. 

### Change Sets and their export status
You can select the **Change Sets button** to review and adjust your Token Set configuration. 

You'll see a list of all **Token Set Names** you've already created and their Export status. 
- Adjust the status by changing the Toggle next to the token name

![](/variables-and-styles/export-Sets-changeSets-V2-01.png)

By changing the status of your Token Sets, you are telling the plugin which Tokens Sets should be included in the Export. 
- The plugin applies your **Export Options** to all compatible tokens included in the Export.

![](/variables-and-styles/export-Sets-changeSets-status-V2-01.png)

#### Enabled Token Sets are exported
Token Sets with the toggle active on the checkmark icon are `Enabled` and will be included in the Export. 

These Tokens are created or updated as Styles and Variables, depending on your **Export Options**.

#### Reference Token Sets are included in the export
Token Sets with the toggle active on the curly bracket icon have the `Reference Only` status. 

They are not directly exported, but this status reminds the Plugin that these token sets work together with the **Enabled Token Sets** and should be included in the export in a limited capacity. 
- Changes to the values of Tokens in **Reference Only** sets are not updated during the export.
- Tokens added or removed in **Reference Only** sets are not updated during the export.

You can run a second **Export** with only these Token Sets as **Enabled** if you want to fully update Figma with changes you've made in the plugin. 

#### Disabled Token Sets are ignored
Token Sets with the toggle active on the x icon have the `Disabled` status and will be ignored during the export status. 

If Tokens were updated or new Tokens were added to these Tokens Sets, this information will not be passed on to Figma during the Export. 

## Confirm and complete the Export to Figma
Once you have confirmed the **Token Sets** to be included in the Export, you'll return to the **Export from Token Sets** page. 

If needed, you can review the **Export Options** by selecting the **Options button** from the bottom of the plugin. 

‚Üí [Read the Export to Figma Options guide for more details.](/variables-and-styles/export-to-figma-options-menu)

Select the **Export to Figma button** at the bottom of the plugin to complete the process.  

#### Export as Variables feedback messages
When exporting Variables, you'll see a feedback message at the bottom of your Figma file depending on your configuration. 
- If you are creating new Collections of Variables or adding Variables within an existing collection, the message will show a count of what was created (right side of the image below). 
- If you are updating existing Variables, the message will tell you that no Variables were created, but will not tell you that Variables were changed (left side of the image below).

### Check your exported Styles and Variables
Check the exported Styles and Variables to ensure you have the output to Figma you expected. 
- This is highly variable based on the combination of the **Export Options** and the **Token Sets** you selected to export. 

Recall that each export is limited to the Tokens included in the Sets selected for this Export. 
- This means you may have to repeat the Export to Figma process with different configurations to update your Styles and Variables completely. 

However, if you have unexpected results, review these guides, which cover the common troubleshooting tips:
- [Export to Figma Overview](/variables-and-styles/export-to-figma-overview)
	- Compatible Token Types with Styles and Variables.
- [Export to Figma Options](/variables-and-styles/export-to-figma-options-menu)
	- a detailed guide on each Export Option.

	- Reasons why some tokens can't be exported.

## Limitations with Variables
There are some known limitations between Tokens Studio and Figma Variables.

### Scoping and Hide from Publishing
Tokens Studio is not able to control Figma's Scoping or Hide from Publishing features. 
- Once you've created the Variables, you can use the Figma native UI to adjust the desired settings. 

### Tokens skipped when exporting as Variables
When Exporting to Figma, the plugin sometimes can't create or update your Variables as expected.
