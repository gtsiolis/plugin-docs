# Export your Tokens as Styles or Variables
As of the plugin's V2 launch, we are happy to support 21 unique `Token Types` that can be exported to Figma as Styles or Variables. 

The **Export** feature creates and updates Styles or Variables attached to the Tokens with the same name in the plugin. This allows Tokens Studio to be the single place to manage design Tokens, Styles, and Variables in Figma. 

Each time you **Export to Figma**, you choose:
- The type of Style or Variables to export.
- Which Themes or Token Sets are included in the export.

## Supported Token Types
You may select the name of the **Token Type** below to learn more about that token type or keep reading to learn more about [Exporting to Figma.](/variables-and-styles/export-to-figma-options-menu)

## How it works 
Once you have created your Tokens in the plugin, select the **Styles & Variables Button** from the Tokens page. 
- Select **Export styles & variables**.
- Review the **Export to Figma Options** and select your configuration based on your desired task. 
- Choose to Export as **Themes** or **Token Sets**
	- Select which Theme or Sets to export
- Confirm and complete the export. 

![](/variables-and-styles/tokens-export-flow-ref-2-01.png)

### Export to Figma options
The **Export to Figma options** allow you to make some key configurations:
1. Export your Tokens as Variables, Styles or both.
	- Define which types of variables you want to export.
2. Choose any Style specific settings.
	- Style name modifications.
	- Style values with variable references.
3. Choose any update-specific settings.
	- Token name changes.
	- Remove styles and variables no longer connected to a token.

![](/variables-and-styles/exportFigmaOverview-Options-annotated-v2-0.png)

### Choose to export from Themes or Token Sets
Depending on your Tokens Studio licence and your Token Structure, you can choose to export to Figma connected to Themes or Token Sets.

![](/variables-and-styles/exportFigma-sets-themes-annotated-v2-0.png)
#### Themes (pro)
- Exports your selected Themes to Variables with multiple modes within a collection.
- Maintains a connection with exported Styles and Variables for seamless updates. 
	- Across multiple Figma files if desired. 
- Requires a pro licence for Tokens Studio

→ [Read the Export to Figma from Themes guide for detailed instructions.](/variables-and-styles/export-themes-to-figma-pro)

#### Token Sets
- Exports your selected Token Set to Variables as a separate collections
	- Multiple modes are not supported. 
- Tokens aren't always connected to the Styles and Variables created from Token Sets. 
	- When you update your Tokens, you may have to replace existing Styles and Variables. 

→ [Read the Export to Figma from Token Sets guide for detailed instructions.](/variables-and-styles/export-sets-to-figma)

Once you've confirmed your selection, the Styles or Variables you selected will be **Exported to Figma**. 

### Skipped Tokens 
There are some exceptions where the plugin has to 'skip' exporting some of your Tokens to variables. 

→ [Read the Skipped Variables guide for more details.](/variables-and-styles/export-to-figma-skipped-variables)

## Styles with Variable references
The plugin supports **Styles with Variable references**. This allows you to create Color, Text, and Effect Styles with values connected to Variables, all powered by your Design Tokens. 

This workflow requires a few steps to get started.
