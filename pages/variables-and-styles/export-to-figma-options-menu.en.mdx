# Export to Figma options menu
The **Export to Figma Options** menu has important settings for creating or updating Styles and Variables connected to your Tokens. 

![](/variables-and-styles/Tokens-export-flow-ref-2-01.png)

## In the plugin
Select the **Styles & Variables Button** from the Tokens page and choose **Export Styles & Variables**.

The **Export to Figma Options** menu is the first screen in the flow. 
- If you close the menu, you can open it using the **Options button** at the bottom of the **Export to Figma** modal. 

![](/variables-and-styles/exportSets-optionsFlow-ref-2-01.png)

## Variable and Style type options
You select which Variable and Style type options you want to export each time you use this feature.

![](/variables-and-styles/exportFigmaOptions-variablesStyles-annotated-v2-0.png)

This allows you to **Export** a selection of your Tokens as Variables, for example, primitive colors, then another selection of Tokens as Styles, like your brand colors. 

Or you are working on a new project, and your Color Styles are ready to export, but your Typography is not. 

### 1. Variable type options
Color
- Creates Color Tokens as Variables
String
- Creates Text Tokens as string Variables
Number
- Creates Dimension, Number, Spacing, Sizing, Border Radius, Border Width, and Opacity Tokens as number Variables
Boolean 
- Creates Boolean Tokens as Boolean Variables

### 2. Style type options
Color
- Creates Color Tokens as Styles
Typography
- Creates Typography Tokens as Styles
Effect 
- Creates Box Shadow Tokens as Styles

You can export both Variables and Styles at the same time.
- Except for `Color`, the plugin will block both options from being selected at the same time to prevent undesired outcomes. 

### Compatible Token Types
For the export to be successful, the Variable and Style types you select must be compatible with your Token Types. 

‚Üí Read the Export to Figma overview for a list of Token Types and their compatible Variable types. 

## Tokens exported to Figma should
The options under the **Tokens exported to Figma should** label perform additional functions while creating or updating the Variables and Styles types you've selected. 

![](/variables-and-styles/exportFigmaOptions-TokensShould-annotated-v2-0.png)

### 1. Ignore first part of Token Name for Styles
For **Token Names** that include groups, the **Ignore first part of Token name for Styles** option will export the Tokens as Styles with modified names. 

This is helpful when your **Token Names** include prefixes intended for the Design System Team which are not helpful to see in Figma. 

For example, a Token named `mode-colors.brand.primary.default` 

With this option enabled will be created as a Style named:
`brand.primary.default`

If your **Token Names** don't include any groups and you have this option enabled, the Token can't be exported, and you will see an error message from the plugin. 

>Some Styles were ignored due to Ignore first part of Token name setting

For example, a Token named `mode-colors-brand-primary-default` will have the whole name ignored by the plugin, and the Style can't be created without a name. 

‚Üí Read the Token Naming technical specs for more details on names with groups.

### 2. Prefix Styles with active Theme name
Multiple Tokens with the same name cannot be exported to the same Figma file as Styles. 

When we set up themes in Design Tokens, we have multiple Tokens with the same name but unique values, which live in different Token Sets. 
- Token sets are then grouped into themes. 

For example, we may have a Theme Group called `color-modes` with a few themes called:
- `light`
- `dark`
- `high-contrast`

Each theme has a Token called `mode-colors.brand.primary.default` but a unique value. 
We can't export the same Token to Figma more than once. 

So, if you want the color Styles for each theme exported to the same Figma file, you can enable the `Prefix Styles with the active theme name` setting. 

In this example, you would need to run the **Export to Figma** three times, as each export will only prefix the **active** theme name. 
- Export 1 - `Light theme` active 
	- Return to the themes dropdown, turn this theme off, then repeat with the next theme.
- Export 2 - `Dark theme` active
	- Return to the themes dropdown, turn this theme off, then repeat with the next theme.
- Export 3 - `High-contrast theme` active

After the three exports, you would see Styles in Figma named:
- `light/mode-colors/brand/primary/default`
- `dark/mode-colors/brand/primary/default`
- `high-contrast/mode-colors/brand/primary/default`

### 3. Create Styles with Variable references 
You need to follow a few steps when you want to use Color Styles in Figma and have the value reference a Color Variable. 

Step 1 - Export your `Color Tokens` to Figma as Variables from Themes or Tokens Sets
- Ensure only the Tokens which will appear as the references in the color Styles are selected for export. 

Step 2 - Export your `Color Tokens` to Figma as Styles from Themes or Tokens Sets
- Ensure the **Create Styles with Variable references** option is selected.
- Ensure only the Tokens you want to export as color Styles are selected for export. 
- Ensure your Themes and Token Sets are configured 

Step 3 - Check the newly created Color Styles!
- If the values are showing Hex codes instead of your Variables, don't worry! 
- Repeat step 2 and the plugin will be able to map your Variables to your color Styles.

### 3. Update existing Style and Variable names
When you update the names of Tokens in the plugin that are currently attached to Styles and Variables in Figma, the **Update existing Style and Variable names** setting ensures Figma will be updated with the new names. 

This setting used to be located on the **Plugin Settings Page** previous to Version 2.0

### 5. Remove Styles and Variables without connection to a Token
When you remove Tokens in the plugin that are currently attached to Styles and Variables the **Remove Styles and Variables without connection to a Token** setting will remove those Styles and Variables from Figma. 

This setting used to be located on the **Plugin Settings Page** previous to Version 2.0

## Export as Themes or Token Sets
Once you've configured your **Export Options**, the plugin will bring you to the **Export from Themes or Token Sets** page. 
- If you have a **Free licence** for Tokens Studio, you will **Export as Token Sets**
- If you have a **Pro licence** for Tokens Studio, will will be brought to the **Export as Themes** page
	- Pro licence holders can optionally export as Token Sets, which have limited capabilities compared to Exporting as Themes.

## Skipped Variables
Sometimes, the plugin skips exporting your Tokens to Figma even when you have the desired options configured correctly.
