# Tokens skipped when exporting as Variables
When Exporting to Figma, the plugin sometimes can't create or update your Variables as expected. 

Your **Export to Figma Options** configuration allows you to skip certain types of Variables if needed. 

‚Üí [Read the Export to Figma Options guide for more details.](/variables-and-styles/export-to-figma-options-menu)

However, there are a few other reasons why the plugin might skip exporting your Tokens as variables or creating modes. 

## Variables skipped
There are three main reasons why the plugin will skip creating individual Variables when Exporting to Figma:
1. The **Token Type** isn't compatible with any Variable type. 
2. The **Token Value** isn't supported in Variables.
3. You have exceeded the number of allowed variables. 

### Token type isn't compatible
Figma only supports [4 types of Variables](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/14506821864087-Overview-of-variables-collections-and-modes#h_01H9V3QSVH6TY6982N7YG6QS22), and Tokens Studio supports 24 unique **Token Types** in the plugin. 

While we have figured out how to support most Tokens to Figma as Variables, these are the **Token Types** that will be skipped when you Export to Figma as Variables:
- Asset Token
- Composition Token
- Other Token

‚Üí Read the [Export to Figma Overview guide](/variables-and-styles/export-to-figma-overview) for a full list of Token Types and their compatible Variable Types

These **Token Types** will also be skipped but can be Exported as Styles with Variables referenced in their values:
- Box Shadow Token
- Color Tokens as Gradients
- Border Token
- Typography Composite Tokens
	- Their individual **Property Tokens** ***will*** export as variables when possible, but you need to create Text Styles with Variable references as a second step. 

‚Üí [Read the guide on creating Styles with Variable references](/variables-and-styles/export-to-figma-styles-variable-references)

### Multiple value Tokens 
Figma only supports a single value for a variable. 

This means if you have a Token with multiple values, like a **Color Token** with its value defined as a linear gradient, that Token can not be exported to Figma as a variable. 

Tokens Studio supports multiple values for:
- [**Color Tokens** as gradients](/token-types/token-type-colorgradient)
	- Export as color styles instead. 
- [Border Radius Tokens](/token-types/token-type-border-radius)
- [Spacing Tokens](/token-types/token-type-spacing)

### Value is "AUTO"
The `AUTO` value is used for **Line Height Tokens** and **Typography Composite Tokens** to match Figma's required string value. 

The plugin isn't able to resolve the `AUTO` value but relies on Figma to apply the correct value based on the **Font Size**. 

Figma only accepts numeric values for this property, and therefore, it is skipped when exporting as Variables. 
- When you export as Text Styles, the `AUTO` value will be applied in Figma as expected.

‚Üí [Read the Typography Line Heights guide for more details.](/token-types/token-type-line-height)

### Value contains a percentage (%)
Figma's Number Variables must be unitless.

The plugin will skip Tokens with `%` values that should be exported as Number Variables as it can't resolve the value and pass it over to Figma is a numeric value. 

If the **Token Type** is `text` or `opacity`, those will be exported as those Variables support the percentage value.

### More than 5000 variables in one collection
[Figma has a limit of 5000 variables per collection.](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/14506821864087-Overview-of-variables-collections-and-modes#:~:text=Note%3A%20You%20can%20create%20up%20to%205%2C000%20variables%20per%20collection.)

If you export more than 5000 tokens as variables, we will create the first 5000 and skip the remaining Tokens. 
- This size of the Variable library is bound to lead to memory issues, so you might want to split up your Tokens into multiple collections. 

## Modes skipped
Each Figma plan allows for a different number of modes per Variable collection. 
‚Üí [Read their pricing plan for more details](https://www.figma.com/pricing/#features)

If you are exporting more **Themes** than you are allowed to have as modes in Figma, we will create as many as possible and then skip the remaining. 
- In the plugin, under the **Themes dropdown**, you will see the list of **Themes** in each **Theme group**. 
	- We will create as many as possible, starting at the top. 

In the image below on the left, there are 5 **Themes** within the `brands` Theme Group, and on the right, the first 4 Themes have been created as modes within a Variable collection in Figma called `brands`. The 5th Theme in our list at the bottom called `black-berry` was not exported.

Note that Drafts in Figma don't allow for modes!
- If you are on any paid plan and we aren't exporting your themes as expected, check to see if your Figma file is in your drafts folder. 

The image below shows how to tell if your file is in your Drafts. 
- Move the file to a Figma project then **Export to Figma as Variables** again to create your other modes.
