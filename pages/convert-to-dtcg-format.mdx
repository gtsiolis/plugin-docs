# Convert to W3C DTCG format

If you want to make use of the W3C Design Tokens Community Group format for your tokens, you can do so in the plugin with the click of a button. Your tokens will be converted to the new format automatically.

When it comes to your transformation pipelines for development, more changes to your build setup might be required. We've recently partnered with Amazon to work on Style Dictionary version 4, which will come with W3C DTCG support.
