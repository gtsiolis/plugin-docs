## How it works
Set up a `project` and `API key` in Tokens Studio
- `Configure Tokens Studio as a sync provider` within the plugin.
- Seamlessly `sync your design tokens` between Figma and Tokens Studio to maintain consistency across design and development workflows.
## Tokens studio sync setup Instructions
If you haven't already, sign up for an account at [Tokens Studio](https://app.tokens.studio/). Note that sign-ups will be waitlisted, so you'll need to be invited to the Beta first.
### 1. Create a new project
Once you've logged into your Tokens Studio account:
- Select `New Project` from the top-right corner of the home page
- Give your project a title.
- Now you are looking at the dashboard of your new project. 
- Locate the `Connection String` (ID of the project) on the right side of the page
- Use the `copy button` to copy the connection string to your clipboard
- `Save the Connection ID` and 
- `Store it somewhere safe` as it's needed for the plugin configuration. 

### 2. Creating an API key
From your `project dashboard`, select the `project name` in the top left corner
- Navigate to `Settings`
- Select `API Keys`
- Select `Create API Key`
- Add a `Name` of what the API Key is for. 
	- Example: `fimga-sync`
	- Option to add a `Description` for the API Key
		- Example: `test-token sync to plugin`
- Under `Group` select `Power User`
- Select `create key` 
- `Copy the generated API key` and 
	- `Store it somewhere safe` as it's needed for the plugin configuration.
