# Tokens Studio Platform sync setup guide
Tokens Studio has a standalone web-based platform for dynamic creation and management of design decisions, currently in Beta! 

â†’ More information on the Studio Platform and sign up for Beta access here. TODO

## How it works
- Set up a `project` in Tokens Studio
- For your organization, create an API Key in Tokens Studio
- Configure Tokens Studio as a sync provider within the plugin.
- Seamlessly `sync your design tokens` between Figma and Tokens Studio to maintain consistency across design and development workflows.

## Tokens Studio sync setup Instructions
If you haven't already, sign up for an account at [Tokens Studio](https://app.tokens.studio/). Note that sign-ups will be waitlisted, so you'll need to be invited to the Beta first.
### 1. Create a new project
Once you've logged into your Tokens Studio account:
- Select `New Project` from the top-right corner of the home page
- Give your project a title.
- Now you are looking at the dashboard of your new project. 
- Locate the `Connection String` (ID of the project) on the right side of the page
- Use the `copy button` to copy the connection string to your clipboard
- `Save the Connection ID` and 
- `Store it somewhere safe` as it's needed for the plugin configuration. 

### 2. Creating an API key
From your `project dashboard`, select the `project name` in the top left corner
- Navigate to `Settings`
- Select `API Keys`
- Select `Create API Key`
- Add a `Name` of what the API Key is for. 
  - Example: `figma-sync`
 	- Optional: add a description for the API key
- Under `Group` select `Power User` or `Admin` (or Read-only if that's all you need)
- Select `Create key` 
- Copy the generated API key and store it for later

## Configuring Tokens Studio Plugin
In Figma, open the Tokens Studio plugin and navigate to the `Settings` page 
- Under the `Sync providers` section, select the `Add new` button to see a list of all token storage providers 
- Select `Tokens Studio` 

### 3. Add credentials for Tokens Studio sync
You'll need the information saved from the steps above to complete the sync configuration form. 

#### Name
This is a `nickname` that shows up in the `plugin settings page` later on to identify this specific sync provider configuration. 
- Choose something memorable to you and your project. 
- Example: `Hyma brand exploration`

#### API Key
The `API Key` you created and saved from the steps above. 

#### ID (connection string)
Enter the `Connection String ID` you copied and saved from the steps above. 
- This can typically be found in the project section of your Tokens Stdio sync dashboard.

### 4. Save credentials

Initially you will pull the tokens that you have stored in your project.

You can now go and either create tokens inside the plugin, or on the platform.
- If you make changes on the platform there's a button in the bottom left of the plugin allowing you to pull the latest values.
- If you make changes in the plugin, they will automatically be pushed to Tokens Studio on save.

Note that dynamic token sets (sets created as a graph) will be read-only in the plugin.
